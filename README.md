Bar Roulette -- HackUpstate 2015

Hackathon project built in 24 hours using Rails, MongoDB, YelpAPI, and UberAPI. 

Bar Roulette is an application to make bar hopping easier and more fun. It takes your current location and using the YelpAPI randomly returns a bar within a 5 mile radius. Using the UberAPI you can then arrange to have a car come pick you up with the click of a button, or you can search again to return a different bar.

My role was to help configure Rails using MongoDB as our database, and set up the YelpAPI and UberAPI.
